# Code Quality Standards

## Commit Message Convention

All commits MUST follow Conventional Commits format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
```

Valid types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, chore, ci, build, revert

## TypeScript Requirements

- NO `any` types - be explicit with types
- NO non-null assertions (`!`) - handle null cases properly
- MUST handle promises properly (no floating promises)
- USE optional chaining (`?.`) and nullish coalescing (`??`)
- ALWAYS add return types to functions

## Code Quality Standards

- ALWAYS use curly braces for all blocks
- NO `var` - use `const`/`let`
- USE template literals instead of string concatenation
- NO nested ternaries - use if/else for clarity
- Functions should have <= 5 parameters
- Files should be <= 1000 lines

## Import Organization

Imports MUST be organized in this order with blank lines between groups:
1. Built-in modules
2. External modules
3. Internal modules
4. Parent imports
5. Sibling imports
6. Index imports

All alphabetically sorted within groups.
