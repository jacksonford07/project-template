# Development Workflow & Git Standards

## CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT RULES

### 1. ALWAYS Read Files Before Modifying

**MANDATORY**: Before making ANY changes to a file, you MUST:
- Read the ENTIRE file first
- Understand the current implementation
- Check for dependencies and usage patterns
- Verify your changes won't break existing functionality

**NEVER**:
- Make blind search/replace changes
- Guess file contents
- Modify files without reading them first

**Why**: Reading first prevents breaking changes, merge conflicts, and incorrect modifications.

### 2. Utilize Existing Utilities (DRY Principle)

**MANDATORY**: Before creating new components/utilities, you MUST:
- Check if it already exists in `components/ui/`
- Check if a utility exists in `lib/`
- Search for similar patterns in the codebase
- Reuse existing components/functions

**Examples**:
- Need a button? Check `Button` component first
- Need date formatting? Check `format-utils.ts` or `date-utils.ts`
- Need API calls? Check existing services in `lib/`

**Why**: Prevents duplication, maintains consistency, reduces code to maintain.

### 3. DO NOT Push Without Explicit Instruction

**MANDATORY**: After committing:
- Wait for user approval before pushing
- User will say "push" or "deploy" when ready
- NEVER automatically push after committing
- NEVER assume user wants changes pushed immediately

## Pre-Commit Workflow

Before committing, your code will automatically be:
1. **Linted** - ESLint checks and auto-fixes
2. **Formatted** - Prettier formatting
3. **Validated** - Commit message checked

## Commit Process

### Good commits
```bash
git commit -m "feat(auth): add oauth2 support"
git commit -m "fix(queue): resolve memory leak in processor"
git commit -m "docs(api): update rate limiting documentation"
```

### Bad commits (will be rejected)
```bash
git commit -m "fixed stuff"
git commit -m "WIP"
git commit -m "Feature: Added login"  # Wrong format
```
